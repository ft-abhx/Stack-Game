# Stack-Game

## Objective
To implement a simple stack game using the jack programming language

## 
Stack is a simple game where the goal is to build a stack of blocks as high as possible.At each level, a row of blocks moves sideways and the user has to place the blocks in 
place and timing it so that it aligns with the previous level. Blocks that don't align are  lost and if no blocks aligned at all, the player loses the game. As the stack levels 
increases, the blocks move faster and faster making the timing even more challenging.
